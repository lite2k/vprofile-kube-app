This branch builds upon the kubernetes manifest files in `main` branch, by using Jenkinsfile to create a pipeline and helm to deploy and manage the vprofile app stack.

I don't own the following files:
- pom.xml
- src/

These belong to [Imran Teli](https://github.com/imranteli) and his wonderful [Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/decodingdevops/) at udemy.
Original Repo for the previous files [Vprofile-project](https://github.com/devopshydclub/vprofile-project).
As such I won't and shouldn't take any credit for the work presented by those resources.

Other than that, the rest is my own work.
